====== Intro ======

Android-Clutter is a set of scripts helping you to build Clutter based
applications for Android. This project mostly relies on jhbuild to
compile all the libraries with the right options.

====== First setup ======

To build Clutter and all its dependencies run :

$ ./build-clutter-android.sh

This script will take care of downloading the Android SDK/NDK for you.

====== Setup and Compile the demo app ======

Once the stack is compiled you can setup and install the demo app by
running :

$ source android-env.sh
$ make ohand-app-full

After you setup the app, any modification to the app can be compiled
and installed by running :

$ make ohand-app
